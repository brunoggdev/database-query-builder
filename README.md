# database-query-builder

Made from absolute scratch, this is a very simple yet quite powerful project,
totally independent from other libraries, consisting of only a class that abstracts PDO
to connect to a database and build up queries to it through chaining methods.

For now, you can simply download and import the Database.php file.

# TODO

* Add usage examples
* Maybe make use of exceptions
* Maybe configure to get through composer
